Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
This project focuses on building a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to predict the Close price of a stock based on historical stock data. The model aims to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in stock prices to improve forecasting accuracy.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Predict future stock Close prices using historical data.

Utilize LSTM layers to model time-based dependencies in stock price movements.

Incorporate numerical features and date-related components (year, month, day, etc.) for enhanced predictions.

Minimize prediction error (Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error) to support trading strategies and market analysis.

Workflow Overview
Data Loading

Read historical stock data including Close prices and date information.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualize stock trends and feature relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Data Preprocessing

Feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

Create sequences suitable for LSTM input.

Split dataset into training and test sets.

Model Development

Build a Sequential neural network with:

LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns.

Dense layers for regression output.

Dropout layers for regularization.

Compile model with Adam optimizer and appropriate loss function.

Apply EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting.

Model Evaluation

Evaluate using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² score

Visualize actual vs predicted Close prices.

Expected Outcome
The model should learn meaningful temporal patterns in stock data.

Accurate predictions of Close prices with minimized error.

Visual validation of model performance through plots comparing true and predicted values.
